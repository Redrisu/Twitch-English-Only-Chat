# Twitch.tv-English-Only-Chat
A chrome extension that can make the twitch chat English-only. Filter the characters of other language. Character from other language will not show. 
It's my first time making an extension and as it works well I want to share it to who needs, maybe it looks really unprofessional. Please excuse that. 

## How To Use
Download the EnglishOnlyExtension folder and save it somewhere. 
Go to Google Chrome extension, enable Developer mode. 
Click 'Load Unpacked', find the folder where you save EnglishOnlyExtension, select the folder. 

## If you need more function
This version is just a simple one. And as my skill is limited, I don't add many function on it. 
But it can be extended esaily, like filter specific language(eg. Only block Chinese/Japanese/Korean character), choose which language to block flexibly, block in more websites with flexible switch, etc. 
Or it can be modified into keyword blocker in Twitch or other website. Add keyword list and block them from showing in your screen. Or replace them with something other. 
If you know how to do it, that would be the best and I'm really appreciate you can make more function. Or tell me your demands and I will have a try. 

# Twitch.tv 过滤非英文字符.
过滤twitch上面所有非英文的字符, 我只想好好看比赛, 不想看他们吵政治.
第一次做, 很粗糙, 凑活用吧.
## 使用方法
下载EnglishOnlyExtension到文件夹. 
浏览器打开插件页面, 打开开发者模式, 导入下载的文件夹即可. 

## 更多功能
受限于我的技术, 我没有实现很多功能. 
可能实现的更多功能有: 指定屏蔽某一种语言或者某些字符. 在更多网页上使用这个插件. 添加方便的开关等等. 或者屏蔽关键词, 关键词替换等等. 
如果你知道怎么改进并且愿意自行增加一些功能, 我会很感谢. 
或者你提出要求, 我可以努力一下.
